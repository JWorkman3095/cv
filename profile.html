            <p>
                Prior to attending <a href= "https://maxtrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MAX Technical Training Bootcamp </a> 
                I spent years working in retail warehousing, maunfacturing and the logistics industry.
                When the pandemic hit in 2020 I found myself unemployed and wondering what I was going
                 to do next. I knew that years of being a 
                singer-songwriter and touring to suppliment my income was also not going to provide 
                the lifestyle I had grown acustom to, especially since that industry was also hit hard.
                I spoke with a now former band mate, who graduated in 2021, and he told me all
                about the great experience he had during his enrollment. When everyone started returning back to work
                I found myself in an environment that wasn't going to last long or
                provide me with any oppurtunities for advancment.
                I had never been more unhappy getting up everyday to go to a job
                than I was in 2021. That is when I made the decision to alter my course and take matters
                into my own hands. I called MAX!

<div>
    <p>
        I am also a U.S. Army Veteran and spent my fomative years, after high school, training
        throughout the United States and Europe. When I decided that I was going to be attending a "Boot Camp"
        I thought to myself, "I have done this once already so I know how to handle it!" I can honestly say
        that my first go around was tough, both mentally and physically. The C# / .NET MAXimum Coding Boot Camp
        is no cake walk!
