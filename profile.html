            <p>
                Prior to attending <a href= "https://maxtrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MAX Technical Training Bootcamp </a> 
                I spent years working in retail warehousing, maunfacturing and the logistics industry.
                When the pandemic hit in 2020 I found myself unemployed and wondering what I was going
                 to do next. I knew that years of being a 
                singer-songwriter and touring to suppliment my income was also not going to provide 
                the lifestyle I had grown acustom to, especially since that industry was also hit hard.
                I spoke with a now former band mate, who graduated in 2021, and he told me all
                about the great experience he had during his enrollment. When everyone started returning back to work
                I found myself in an environment that wasn't going to last long or
                provide me with any oppurtunities for advancment.
                I had never been more unhappy getting up everyday to go to a job
                than I was in 2021. That is when I made the decision to alter my course and take matters
                into my own hands. I called MAX!

<h2 class="fw-bold">Life During Bootcamp</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Being a U.S. Army Veteran I figured since I had been 
        through Boot Camp once already that I could tackel this new challange.
        I can honestly say that my first go around was tough, both mentally and physically.
        The C# / .NET MAXimum Coding Boot Camp is no cake walk! It's just as tough! It may very well be
        one of thee most challanging things I have ever done.
        All of my prior training aided in giving me the confidence that I could continue
        on those days that I was feeling overwhelmed and struggling.

        Having folks on your side who want you to succeed makes a world of diffence. The instructors have held 
        us acctountable and at the same time provided the information and support to reach our goals.
        There are days when it seemed too much. I didn't think I could read one more term or definition,
        but then you find the support and encouragment to drive on. 
        Former students, collegues, staff members all say, "Take some time and step away, take a break, relax and 
        then get back to it." Sometimes that is all it took. When I could not see the forest because of the trees
        a step away was all I needed to get back at it. The reward of seeing the results makes all the long hours worth it.
