        <p>
            Prior to attending <a href= "https://maxtrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MAX Technical Training Bootcamp </a> 
            I spent years working in retail warehousing, maunfacturing and the logistics industry.
            I am also a U.S. Army Veteran and spent my fomative years, after high school, training
            throughout the United States and Europe. When the pandemic hit in 2020 I found myself
            unemployed and wondering what I was going to do next. I knew that years of being a 
            singer-songwriter and touring to suppliment my income was also not going to provide 
            the lifestyle I had grown acustom to, especially since that industry was also hit hard.
            I spoke with a now former band mate, who graduated in 2021, and he began telling me all
            about the great experience he had. When everyone returned back to work I found myself working
            in a location I disiked GREATLY. I had never been more unhappy getting up everyday to go to a job
            than I was in 2021. That is when I made the decision to alter my course and take matters
            into my own hands. I called MAX!
